GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/predict?text="I've been around the area for quite some time to see this particular location change from one restaurant to another but finally I was tempted enough by the new owner's menu. I've walked by the place a couple of times to see it go from nothing to what I saw today. The place inside looked so inviting that it really made me want to come again(after quarantine is over)just for the ambiance. The menu is simple yet creative and spoke to my cravings. I decided to get the fried calamari, the springtime salad with salmon, the watermelon passion drink and the emerald pasta. EVERYTHING IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS PLACE I'm coming back-for-sure-hands-down-no-doubt-about-it. The service is GREAT from the phone to in person. The food quality, quantity, and price are all 10/10 in my book. And let me tell you my book is exclusive, I'm usually not this impressed by a restaurant to really want to even write a review for it."
